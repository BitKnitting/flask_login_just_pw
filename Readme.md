# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn (and provide a template for) using:  
* the Flask-Login library.  The example use case is entering a password to gain access to a web page.
* the Flask-dotenv library to use both private (.env file - not checked into GitHub) and public (.flashenv - e.g.: FLASH_APP and FLASH_ENV are defined here) variables.
* the Flask-WTF library for handling forms in Flask.
* the Flask-Bootstrap4 library so the web pages look "professional" without me having to cruft all the fancy-schmanzy CSS
* PyCharm as a "time saver" IDE for Flask apps.
# Resources
* Flask-Login 
  * I subscribe to Treehouse. I found Kenneth's course, [_Build a Social Network with Flask_](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-social-network-with-flask) the best way for me to learn how to set up and use Flask-Login.
