from flask_login import UserMixin
# Using functions from flask_bcrypt to check the hashed password, which is in the .env
# file.  The hashed password is created outside of the flask app and then stored in
# .env as an attribute that is then checked using the check_password_hash function.
# To create the password:
# >>>from flask_bcrypt import generate_password_hash
# >>> generate_password_hash('password')
# copy the output to be the value of the attribute within .env.
